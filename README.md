lossbot is proudly dedicated to sending a (probably) unique loss.jpg image each day on as many
platforms as I can be bothered to add. If anyone else finds this as funny as I do, pull requests for
other platforms are welcome. Python is preferred, but any language is welcome.

The currently implemented platforms are:

- Discord as [Daily Loss Bot#5278](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1190004024410374224&permissions=2048&scope=bot)
- Mastodon as [@dailylossbot@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@dailylossbot)
- Bluesky as [@dailylossbot.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/dailylossbot.bsky.social)

Major list of todos at the moment:

- More platforms
- Alt text (I should have done this to begin with)
- Gathering more images (please send any and all loss.jpg images my way, even if you think I've
already seen it)
